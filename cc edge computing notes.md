# Edge computing
- edge computing enables data to be analyzed and processed and transferred at the edge of network.
- The idea is to analyze data locally, closer to where it is stored in realtime without latency
- To leverage 5G wireless technology and AI to enable faster reponse time, lower latency (ability to process very high volume of data with minimal delay) and simplif maintainence in cloud computing.
- **Edge Computing** is extension of cloud computing
